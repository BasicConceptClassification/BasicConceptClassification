Task #1:
You might need go to my github get the code sorry the inconvenient 
	$ git clone https://github.com/zuoyu/quiz.git
 Please follow the steps to set up:< Django is verison 1.10>1.in terminal install the virtualenv (Using python2.7)	$ virtualenv .env
2.active the .env	$ source .env/bin/activate3.do the quiz directory	$ cd quiz4.install the requirement	$ pip install –r requirement.txt5.migrate	$ python manage.py migrate6.create a supper user which is admin	$ python manage.py createsupersuer7.run the server	$ python manage.py runserver8. you will put get a server (http://127.0.0.1:8000/), please go to the admin page to login (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)

9. you will add question in the admin page, and also view the answer in the admin page.

10. after you add 12 questions you can go to (http://127.0.0.1:8000/questions/) that is the page for client to submit the answer.

11. if you want to view the answer you can go back to (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) click answers to see client’s answer and it will have the session hence you can separate different clients for later analysis.

Task #2:In the model Asset there are two elements asset_file and metadata, this two are the main data usage comes from I think. Hence, the calculate the data usage will be asset_file.size + metadata.size

I think it might have two ways to solve if it applied to a larger scale:
    1. To cache the calculated data usage all the time and if the user use some new data add to the calculated data usage.
    2. To change the model, we can add a new attribute in Asset or Client called data_usage to record the data usage.

for any arbitrary data model:
    1. To change the model, we can add a new attribute in Client called data_usage to record the data usage.
    2. create a new column in db called data_usage to record.

Task #3:
During my research it use the Geographic information system to return the location info (I think) but I don’t know how does it label those geometry data.
If assume I know how does the data labeled, then I could get those data out and separate them as different categories. No matter what kind of the formatting clients want, it can easily re-format and display to them.
the challenges might be 
	1. can’t decode some data info.   
	2. Some of the part of the data is unreadable, even the client get the data don’t know what is that means.
