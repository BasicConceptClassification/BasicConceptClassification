        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) around the world have databases that are ineffective to search
            through due to isolated systems and a non-uniform vocabulary. <b><i>Basic Concepts Classification</i></b> hopes
            to address both these problems with an easy to learn platform for classification and searching of the collections
            of GLAMs around the world.</p>
        <p>With this system, curators from different institutions will be able to add items to a centralized database, and all
            users will be able to search through this database.</p>
