## What's in here?

Here is the grpah database that you'll need to run our product. 
It has some sample data that you can use with this repository to see how it would work.

## How to use it

1. Download Neo4j 
2. Unzip this file in a location outside of the repo (or please do not include in commmits to avoid conflicts.)
3. Start the Neo4j Community, select the uncompressed graphDB and the click Start.

Now you can run our Project with our database!
