Melencolia (  variety of objects and batlike creature in background  ), 
Marchesa Brigida [facial expression, stance, things being held are classificatory desiderata for portraits], 
Lacoon  Mention might be made of both the (Trojan horse)  and (Toledo) in the background., 
Judith Self Portrait - Leyster painted with the informal style of Franz Hals; this should be captured under style, 
Rembrandt ( We might have to add (likely) before (brooding).), 
young girl reading (The painter clearly approves of young girls reading; not everyone did.),  
Watson and the shark (Emotions of rescuers clearly differ.), 
Wivenhow Park (Is ‘placid’ the default case for landscapes?),  
Skipped to a couple modern works:       [Note that classification by style and painter will do much for these works], 
Vertical constellation with bomb (Need to define mobile.)
