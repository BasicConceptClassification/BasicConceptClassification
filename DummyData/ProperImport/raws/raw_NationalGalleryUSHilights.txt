Abrader  (tool)(for)(smoothing)
Adobe (clay)(for)(building)
Adze Blade (blade)(of)(tool)(for)(carving)(wood) [there are similar tools like mattock going under quite different names]
Adze Head (head?)(of)(tool)(for)(carving)(wood)
Antler Artifact  (artifact)(from)(antler)
Apache Tear (round)(nodules)(obsidian)
Apron [might signal by name, or (clothing)(to protect)(clothing)
Armor Slat  [It take a while to find out what this is. They are wooden slats tied together as armor by native Americans. Similar armor may have been used in other parts of the world?] (flat)(wood)(for)(armor)   armor is (protection)(for)(war)   [There were other kinds of native American armor: some used wooden rods tied together – this similarity will be captured by a synthetic approach; many used hides, sometimes hardened with other substances, sometimes padded with cotton – again a synthetic approach captures similarity and difference.]
Arrow  (long)(round)(pointed)(projectile)(weapon) where (projectile) is (object)(propelled) [note that ‘bow’ is harder to describe.]  [A good place to talk about how we have to make decisions about when to stop breaking into more basic. It could well be that ‘bow’ and ‘arrow’ are best treated as basic, but defined in terms of other basic concepts]
Arrow Foreshaft  (front)(long)(part of)(arrow)
Arrow Shaft  (long)(part of)(arrow)
Atlatl  (weapon)(for)(throwing)(spear)   [Note that a spear is really a big arrow. But they are fired in different ways]
Atlatl Foreshaft
Atlatl Shaft
Awl  (long)(pointed)(spike) Note that there are different types of awl, which can be defined by use: (making)(holes)(in)(wood)   or (scratching/carving)(wood)  or  (making)(holes)(in)(leather)
Axe  (tool)(for)(cutting)(wood)  [Note that it can cut other things; also be used for carving; also as a weapon]  [Better perhaps define by form: (sharp)(blade)(with)(long)(handle) Note that the big difference between adze and axe is whether blade is that the head of an adze is perpendicular to the shaft.
